# TSVPS

Python script to solve a NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization similar to the [Traveling-Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) for a specific dataset that can be connected to the [MapBox API](https://www.mapbox.com/).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need Gurobi Optimization library, you can try it out with a free trial here.

```

```

### Running

The published script comes ready to run with automatic generation of its dataset. 

```
py main.py
```

### Configuration

Further configuration can be achieved by adding a MapBox API Key and enabling XRouter in the router module.

## Built With

* [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/free-trial/) - Python optimization library
* [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/) - Map & Location API
